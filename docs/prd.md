# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name: **TafsiriLaw â€“ Legal AI Assistant on Internet Computer (ICP)**
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Owner:** [Samuel Njiraini]  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 1. Overview
TafsiriLaw is a decentralized legal virtual assistant platform hosted on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It allows legal firms to deploy, fine-tune, and operate their own private legal LLMs (Large Language Models) to automate legal workflows such as research, drafting, and review while maintaining strict data confidentiality using IPFS and on-device computation.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
Law firms are reluctant to adopt commercial AI platforms due to the following reasons:

- **Confidentiality risks**: Legal data is highly sensitive, subject to attorney-client privilege, and governed by strict compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Document overload**: Legal practitioners are burdened with reading and analyzing large volumes of case-related documents.
- **High operational cost**: Routine tasks like legal research, contract analysis, and communication consume time and require manpower (e.g., paralegals or junior associates).

---

## 3. Goals and Objectives
TafsiriLaw aims to:

- Provide each legal firm with a **private, dedicated LLM** hosted in their own decentralized canister.
- Allow for **firm-specific fine-tuning** using jurisdiction-specific data and case documents.
- Ensure **secure data handling** via encrypted storage on IPFS and optional on-device processing.
- Enable **automation of routine legal tasks** to improve efficiency and reduce cost.
- Maintain **auditability and transparency** via access logs and usage tracking.
